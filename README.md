# Analyzing Conversions Using A/B Test

In this project, i will be analyzing an e-commerce company's website data. The company has developed a new webpage, and wants to know if it is better on attracting customers to buy its products. The goal is to help the company decide if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. The analysis is done using probabilistic technique and A/B testing as well as a regression approach.
